## 📊 Key Insights

Here are some insights uncovered during analysis:

1. **Top Categories:** Most apps belong to the *Family*, *Game*, and *Tools* categories.  
2. **Free vs Paid:** Free apps dominate the Play Store, but paid apps often have slightly higher ratings.  
3. **App Size:** Medium-sized apps tend to receive better user ratings.  
4. **Price Trends:** Most paid apps are under \$5, with a few exceptions in specialized categories.  
5. **Correlation:** Number of installs is positively correlated with the number of reviews and rating count.
